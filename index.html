  <h1>ü•ê Lviv Croissants</h1>
  <p>
    Lviv Croissants is a company that in 7 years has grown into a national franchise network with a wide range of large
    freshly baked croissants with various fillings.
    </br>
    What was the impetus for opening this business?
    </br>
    Every business starts with an idea. </br>
    During another food testing for
    a
    new menu, which included croissants for tasting, an unforeseen situation occurred.</br>

    Accidental non-observance of defrosting and baking technology resulted in extremely tasty large croissants. </br>
    It was
    this
    case that laid the foundation for the successful business of Lviv Croissants.
